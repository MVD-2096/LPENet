## Definition of camouflaged defects
Upon closer observation, we find that such defects can actively or passively blend into the background in terms of visual appearance, thereby evading perception. This visual concealment phenomenon is referred to as camouflage in the computer vision domain. Inspired by this concept, we formally define such defects as **Camouflaged Defects**.
