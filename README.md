# Seeing Through the Background: Camouflaged Defect Detection with an Information-Guided Network
## Can you find the defect?

## Definition of camouflaged defects：
Upon closer observation, such defects can actively or passively blend into the background in terms of visual appearance, thereby evading perception. This visual concealment phenomenon is referred to as camouflage in the computer vision domain. Inspired by this concept, we formally define such defects as **Camouflaged Defects**.\\

**Camouflaged Defects：** Camouflaged defects refer to defects that exhibit highly similar patterns to the surrounding background, to deceive the perceptual system of humans.
## Motivation：
• Existing leading defect detection models exhibit limited generalization capability for camouflaged defect detection.

• Research on camouflaged defect detection still remain limited, mainly due to the lack of a sufficiently large dataset benchmark currently.
## Highlights：

•  We formally define camouflaged defects in industrial inspection for the first time.

•  We construct the first dataset dedicated to camouflaged defects.

•  We propose IGDNet with DSP and IFAM modules for pixel-level camouflaged defect detection.
