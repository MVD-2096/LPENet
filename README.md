## Definition of camouflaged defects
Observation: Such defects can actively or passively blend into the background in terms of visual appearance, thereby evading perception. This visual concealment phenomenon is referred to as camouflage in the computer vision domain. Inspired by this concept, we formally define such defects as **Camouflaged Defects**.\\

**Camouflaged Defects：** Camouflaged defects refer to defects that exhibit highly similar patterns to the surrounding background, to deceive the perceptual system of humans.
